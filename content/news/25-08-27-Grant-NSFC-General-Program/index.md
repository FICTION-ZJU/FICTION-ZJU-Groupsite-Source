Our project proposal has been granted for funding by the NSFC General Program.

Our project proposal titled "Fixed-Point Theories for Quantitative Verification and Symbolic Inference of Probabilistic Programs" has been granted for funding by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) as a General Program. The project aims to establish a universal fixed-point semantic model for loopy probabilistic programs possibly exhibiting divergent behaviors and conditioning. It seeks for a comprehensive system of theories, methods, and techniques for automated quantitative verification and highly accurate symbolic inference of probabilistic programs.
