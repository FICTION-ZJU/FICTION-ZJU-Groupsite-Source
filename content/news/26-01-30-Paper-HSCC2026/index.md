Our paper titled "[Derivative-Agnostic Inference of Nonlinear Hybrid Systems](/publication/YU-HSCC2026/)" by {{% mention "Hengzhi Yu" %}}, {{% mention "Bohan Ma" %}}, {{% mention "Mingshuai Chen" %}},{{% mention "Huangying Dong" %}}, Jie An, Bin Gu, Naijun Zhan, and Jianwei Yin has been accepted by HSCC 2026, in Saint Malo, France. This article presents a derivative-agnostic approach, named Dainarx, for inferring nonlinear hybrid systems whose dynamics are captured by nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) models. Dainarx employs NARX models as a unified, threshold-free representation for both mode switching and segment clustering. We show that Dainarx suffices to learn models that closely approximate a general class of hybrid systems featuring high-order nonlinear dynamics with exogenous inputs, nonlinear guard conditions, linear resets, and noise. Experimental results on a collection of benchmarks demonstrate that our approach effectively and efficiently infers nontrivial hybrid automata with high-order dynamics, yielding significantly more accurate approximations than state-of-the-art techniques, while achieving robustness comparable to approaches dedicated to fitting noisy data.
