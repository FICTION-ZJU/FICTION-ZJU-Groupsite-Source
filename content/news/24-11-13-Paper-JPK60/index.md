Our paper titled "[A Unified Framework for Quantitative Analysis of Probabilistic Programs](/publication/feng-jpk60/)" by Shenghua Feng (Zhongguancun Lab), Tengshun Yang (ISCAS), {{% mention "Mingshuai Chen" %}}, and Naijun Zhan (PKU) has been published as a book chapter in JPK's Festschrift -- [Principles of Verification: Cycling the Probabilistic Landscape](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-75783-9). This paper presents a unified framework for the quantitative analysis of probabilistic programs, which incorporates and extends existing results on the analysis of termination, temporal properties, and expected cost. We dedicate this article to our dear colleague Joost-Pieter Katoen on the occasion of his 60th birthday, who has been tirelessly pushing the limits of, amongst others, (automated) quantitative analysis of probabilistic programs.
