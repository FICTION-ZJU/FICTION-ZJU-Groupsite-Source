**Abstract**: This talk shares how ideas from object-oriented programming can help us rethink the way we write and organize machine-checked proofsâ€”and how different paradigms can come together in surprising ways.

**Bio**: Yizhou Zhang is an Assistant Professor at the Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo. His research home is in programming languages and compilers, with a focus on designing programming models and language abstractions that combine expressive power, efficient implementation, and strong correctness guarantees.

Yizhou received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Cornell University. His work has been recognized with an ACM SIGPLAN Distinguished Paper Award and an Amazon Research Award.
