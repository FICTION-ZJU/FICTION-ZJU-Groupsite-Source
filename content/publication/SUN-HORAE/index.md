abstract: Artificial intelligence is rapidly encroaching on the field of service regulation. However, existing AI-based regulation techniques are often tailored to specific application domains and thus are difficult to generalize in an automated manner. This paper presents <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Horae</span>, a unified specification language for modeling (multimodal) regulation rules across a diverse set of domains. We showcase how <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Horae</span> facilitates an intelligent service regulation pipeline by further exploiting a fine-tuned large language model named RuleGPT that automates the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Horae</span> modeling process, thereby yielding an end-to-end framework for fully automated intelligent service regulation. The feasibility and effectiveness of our framework are demonstrated over a benchmark of various real-world regulation domains. In particular, we show that our open-sourced, fine-tuned RuleGPT with 7B parameters suffices to outperform GPT-3.5 and perform on par with GPT-4o.
