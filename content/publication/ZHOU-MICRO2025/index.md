abstract: "Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (qLDPC) codes are a promising class of quantum error-correcting codes that exhibit constant-rate encoding and high error thresholds, thereby facilitating scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, real-time decoding of qLDPC codes remains a significant challenge due to the high connectivity of their check matrices, which typically requires solving large-scale linear systems with sparse structures. In particular, off-the-shelf qLDPC decoders are often subject to a tradeoff between accuracy and latency, thus yielding no accurate and real-time decoding. This paper presents Vegapunk, a software-hardware co-design framework that enables real-time qLDPC decoding with high accuracy. To improve decoding accuracy, we design an offline decoupling strategy leveraging Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) optimizations to mitigate quantum degeneracy; To enable fast decoding, we introduce an online hierarchical decoding algorithm employing a greedy strategy. Furthermore, we show that our SMT-optimized strategy suffices to produce decoupled matrices with maximized sparsity, thus admitting a dedicated accelerator to fully exploit the sparsity and parallelism to achieve real-time qLDPC decoding. Experimental results demonstrate that Vegapunk enables real-time decoding (< 1Î¼s) for the Bivariate Bicycle (BB) code up to [[784,24,24]] while exhibiting logical error rates on par with the state-of-the-art decoder, e.g., BP+OSD."
