abstract: Self-improving large language models (LLMs) -- i.e., to improve the performance of an LLM by fine-tuning it with synthetic data generated by itself -- is a promising way to advance the capabilities of LLMs while avoiding extensive supervision. Existing approaches to self-improvement often rely on external supervision signals in the form of seed data and/or assistance from third-party models. This paper presents <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Crescent</span> -- a simple yet effective framework for generating high-quality synthetic question-answer data in a fully autonomous manner. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Crescent</span> first elicits the LLM to generate raw questions via a bait prompt, then diversifies these questions leveraging a rejection sampling-based self-deduplication, and finally feeds the questions to the LLM and collects the corresponding answers by means of majority voting. We show that <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Crescent</span> sheds light on the potential of true self-improvement with zero external supervision signals for math reasoning; in particular, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Crescent</span>-generated question-answer pairs suffice to (i) improve the reasoning capabilities of an LLM while preserving its general performance (especially in the 0-shot setting); and (ii) distil LLM knowledge to weaker models more effectively than existing methods based on seed-dataset augmentation.
