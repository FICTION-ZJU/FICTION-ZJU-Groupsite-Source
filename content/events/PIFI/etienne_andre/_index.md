**Abstract**: Monitoring cyber-physical systems consists in deciding whether a property is satisfied along one log, i.e., a sequence of samples ordered with time. Monitoring attracts both scientific and practical attention. However, monitoring algorithms suffer from the methodological difficulty of only observing sampled discrete-time signals gathered in a log, while real behaviors are continuous-time signals, which implies some uncertainty. In addition, the monitoring properties can themselves feature some uncertainty: e.g., a period in a property to be monitored can be uncertain or even unknown. In this presentation, we will address some of the challenges related to monitoring using formal methods, and then present two ways to address uncertainty while monitoring cyber-physical systems.

**Bio**: Étienne André has been awarded a PhD degree in computer science in ENS Cachan (nowadays ENS Paris-Saclay), France, in 2010. In 2011, he was appointed associate professor ("maître de conférences") with Université Paris 13, France, then full professor with Université de Lorraine in 2019, and then with Université Sorbonne Paris Nord in 2022. Since 2025, he has been a full professor with Nantes Université, France. He is holding a junior chair (2024-2029) at the Institut Universitaire de France.

His works focus both on the theoretical aspects of formal verification as well as more practical works with applications notably to real-time systems and monitoring cyber-physical systems, with publications in prestigious venues of the field (TACAS, TSE, CAV, ICFEM, AAMAS...).
